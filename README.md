# Multi-class-classification

In this project we implemented Multi class classification by traing the SVM with guassian and polynomial kernel.
The accuracy of the model is calculated using the jaccard similarity.
The project is implemented in Matlab.
The second part of the project is implementation on knn, svm and feed forward neural network
